# COVID-19 AUSTRIA

 Author: Marcelo de Freitas Marreiros A82436
 
 Directory created to submit the Final Project made in scope of the "Systems of Geographical Information" class lectured by [Professor Jorge Rocha](https://github.com/jgrocha).


 ## Motivation
 From the challenge to use Geografical data and Covid-19 data this project was developed. This project mostly relies on the tools provided by QGIS, more specifically PyQGIS. Additionaly it involved some data manipulation using csv files and the pandas library data frames. Lastly matplot lib was extensivly used to make the plots presented bellow.

 ## Data
 All the notebooks in this directory go to the sources of data to get the most up to date information. However this results in a small time window after midnight (00:00 GMT+1) when the data hasn't been updated and the notebooks won't run properly. If this problem occurs simply use the [backup data provided](https://github.com/MarcelodeFreitas/Epidemiology/blob/master/Study%20Cases/AUSTRIA/covid_data/covid-19-at-backup-31-05-2020.csv) or simply don't run the bit of code that gets the covid-19 data from the source.

 	- most of the csv files in this folder result form manipulations in the various notebooks
